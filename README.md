# HaskellExercises
My solutions &amp; notes for the book from http://haskellbook.com/

## _Notes_

1. I put all exercises from a chapter in one stack project. Because there are often dependencies among them.
2. All contents are there in Lib.hs. Chapter numbers could be found in comments.
3. In main module (Main.hs) there is only a hello message as well as some examples commented out. The examples could be tried in ghci.
4. The directories of CHXX are root directories of stack projects. Navigate to a CHXX directory and execute 'stack build' can build the project. Then execute 'stack ghci' to launch ghci and play around.
5. Before 'stack build', 'stack setup' might be needed if the sandbox of compiler is not installed yet.

_Life is short, so I love Python. To make me a little bit different, I love Haskell as well._
